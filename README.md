# DataEnhancedVMC
Code base for Data-Enhanced Variational Monte Carlo, with applications to simulated and experimental quantum data.

The Main folder contains the architectures, training scripts, relevant observable calculations, and helper functions.
The KZ_sims folder contains more specific scripts relevant to my recent arXiv preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02647]{https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02647}. There you will find the source codes for all of the figures in the article, bash scripts detailing the numerical experiments I ran, and some of the data (not all because there is a large amount). If you would like access to all of the data or the trained models, please do not hesitate to reach out.
